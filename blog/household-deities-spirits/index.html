<p>I previously wrote about deities that collectively represent life, death and punishment, and each of them seemed—rather appropriately—to be quite far removed from human society. However, as in any mythology there is a hierarchical order to the divine powers; there the primary and the secondary gods (that includes \"semi-divine\" powers as well). These secondary gods appear to possess less power, yet they are supernatural. </p>\n\n<p>I think it is a good time to consider these secondary gods, starting off with the household gods and </p>\n\n<p>It is essential to stress the variety of the household deities in Lithuanian mythology, some of them are very abstract meanwhile others are quite specific figures that can be associated with household and material possessions. Even though they are household deities, in a lot of cases they can be malevolent and dangerous. Though this malevolent and dangerous quality should not be viewed as something negative. Due to the \"semi-divine\" nature these spirits must possess a feature that force people respect them. </p>\n\n<p>The nature of the household deities and spirits generally comes from the ancestral worship in many societies. First, seen as a \"materialised\" ancestral power or spirit, household deities were very a matter of private dedication to the supernatural. It is interesting how versatile these house spirits are: they can represent protection of home, family, mark protection on harvest. Essentially, they are the representatives of luck within the family which can extend to riches of all kinds.</p>\n\n<p>[I was simply thinking about using the terms: \"pre-Christian\" and \"pagan\" and I cannot simple determine which one is more appropriate especially considering the fact that Lithuanian pagan beliefs continue to pervade society even this day. Therefore, it is extremely hard to decide which term to use as the \"pagan\" term may have a negative connotation, at the same time \"pre-Christian\" is inappropriate as the <em>Christianisation</em> process in Lithuania was not as effective as in the rest of Europe.]</p>\n\n<p>Sacrifice to the household deities was essential in Lithuanian worship. </p>
