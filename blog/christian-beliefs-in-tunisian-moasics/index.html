<p>In this post I am going to digress from our usual topic on Lithuanian mythology to the ''angelic'' depictions in the Roman mosaic art in particular. If to be even more specific, I will inspect the subject  in a previously Roman province known as <em>Proconsularis</em>. (Tunisia) Now this geographical location of the mosaic tradition is pretty random, I have not picked it for any particular recent, but only my accidental observation. This choice may seem even irrational considering the fact that the original mosaic tradition came in the nest of the Roman Empire itself- Italy. However, I do not believe that we should be preoccupied with chronology or the geographical area. Some scholars to tend to be determined on the subject of chronology and present the roots of the mosaic tradition as Greek, but I do not again agree with that. This image of the Aztec mask below simply proves that mosaic art existed outside the European continent and did not necessary emerge in Greece first.</p>\n\n<p>The Roman mosaic art was mainly used for public and private reasons, pavement and household decorations. For the purposes of decorating the household, divine characters as subject were commonly used, therefore, the angels were not an exception. When considering Roman mosaic tradition, a question may arise: what did angels have to do with Roman gods? I think it is easy to make an elementary mistake and to consider the yet Roman influenced, but ''Tunisian'' mosaics. Regarding the mosaic tradition in Tunisia or the so called <em>Proconsularis</em>, which was a Roman province, such feature as time or date is highly significant. </p>\n\n<p>Not moving further to the roots of mosaic art, the Roman tradition probably appeared around 2nd century BC. Even though Tunisia was part of the Roman empire, the mosaics came rapidly to the region. If to look at  the sightly later Roman mosaics, we may observe a development from simply floral or any natural pattern to a portrayal of myths and even calendars.  As for our focus of this post, the winged creatures, characters with halos appear on mosaic art around 1st and 2nd centuries. It is not as simple as it appears from the first sight, predominantly regarding the winged creatures, who may be held for Cupids. For example, there are few misconceptions made by the audience when differentiating angels from Cupids. </p>\n\n<p>In the picture below we have a unique opportunity to observe a mosaic depiction of Cupids riding dolphins. This depiction of the Roman god is highly conventional, but the only conventional feature of this sort of depiction is the dolphin and the fact that the god is seen as a child. What if we would observe this divinity from a closer, more intricate perspective and consider the objects the Cupids are holding, or the fact that they both are portrayed from a very subjective manner? There is no certainty in this consideration, but what if we are about to observe the influence of Christianity in Roman belief or as the very least, depiction of the Roman belief? </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2015/07/1436278039_6b1fbddcfdf44382a7ea7e88a86e5fdd.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Source for this image: <a href=\"http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Bulla2.html\">http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Bulla2.html</a></em></p>\n\n<p>Another possible Christian influence in Roman mosaics can be seen through the portrayal of the Roman gods with halos, such as Neptune or Apollo. It may make sense for Apollo as a sun god to possess a halo, but why should Neptune have one? (if to be very skeptical)</p>
