<p>It is essential to stress that the Lithuanian mythology cannot be simply compared to the ancient Greek, Roman or even Slavic folklore. In my personal view, it is not always useful to observe different mythologies from a comparative perspective as there may be striking diversities that may confuse us considering parallel mythologies. Therefore, in this blog I will not compare Lithuanian mythology to any other, but rather observe it on its own. I believe that seeing Lithuanian mythology as a separate collection of beliefs will simplify the understanding of quite complex and different subject. </p>
<p>As I have mentioned in my introductory section of this blog, I am going to work on Lithuanian mythology first and my primary focus, therefore, will be the grass snake. The reason why why I have decided to start off with the 'informal' analysis of the grass snake is  the importance of the grass snake, which might seem to us unusual. So, I believe that examining the most unconventional part first, would be easier to understand the grounds of the Lithuanian beliefs and practices. </p>
<p>In the original language, which in this case, is Lithuanian, the grass snake or the water snake is called ''Žaltys''. In Lithuanian mythology there are multiple meanings of the grass snake. The grass snake can be seen as a mystical creature, a totem or even a symbol. (Important to note that all have slightly different features, though majorly positive ones) Knowing that, we can immediately notice the ''multifunctionality'' of the grass snake: it is a sacred animal, a deity or even a spirit, and finally,a subject of symbolic value. </p>
<p>Before going into deeper analysis, there are few questions to consider: </p>
<p><em>1. Why is the grass snake important?</em></p>
<p><em>2. Why the grass snake does not have a negative connotation as it does in Christian belief?</em></p>
<p><em>3. Did the attitude towards the grass snake alter over the time?</em></p>
<p>Let us now examine the <em>three main functions</em> of the grass snake in Lithuanian mythology:</p>
<p><strong>The notion of a sacred animal:</strong> first of all, the grass snake was a divine animal. Weirdly enough, people associated the grass snake with its habitat - the forests and the waters (lakes, rivers, in some cases the sea). The grass snake was also held as a pet and fed with milk or peas. There are multiple accounts of the people claiming that the grass snake would come and prefer one food to another and in some cases even dine together with humans. Essentially the creature was a friend of the people and their family. Thus, the grass snake was also believed to be the guardian spirit of their household. It is hard to demonstrate this in English language, but various diminutives were used to domesticate the grass snake and at the same time respect it. It is interesting how such associations of the grass snake as the household and the forest/waters could come together though.</p>
<p>However, the animal nature of the grass snake was not emphasised, the creature only appeared in the form of the grass snake, but under the veil, there was a living deity or spirit, which leads us to the next point/notion. The diverse understanding of the grass snake may seem quite problematic, especially when we try to analyse whether the grass snake is a pet of the house or rather a feared divinity that protects the house from calamities, brings luck and finally on top of that is believed to carry a spirit of ancestors inside.</p>
<p>There is a great emphasis on the differentiation between the snake and the grass snake in Lithuanian mythology: the snake is held to be evil because of the venomous nature, whereas grass snake is thought to be sacred as it is not venomous. The safety of a grass snake is fundamental feature in this mythology: one can caress, kiss and cuddle the creature. Essentially, žaltys is a harmless animal that must be respected due to many reasons, which will be covered in the section on the notion of the grass snake as a deity or a spirit.</p>
<p>The belief of the sacredness has also manifested through the common interaction with the grass snake. Harming the creature  could not be simply understood, it was strictly believed that if someone did anything bad for the grass snake, disasters and even death would follow. Even though the grass snake could possibly bite or harm  as an animal, there were deeply rooted beliefs in bizarre blisters and bodily rot if one harms the grass snake.</p>
<p><strong>The notion of a deity or a spirit:</strong> So, as we know, the grass snake had nothing to do with the snake. However, the process of Christianisation and its influence caused the association of the two animals as being the same. In Christian mentality there was no great difference between the grass snake and just a snake and both animals were held to be symbols of idolatry and the first sin.  Thus, certain beliefs, such as the grass snake being vengeful and mean came to the surface. Returning to my first statement that the grass snake essentially has nothing in common with snake in Lithuanian mythology, I must say that the negative attitudes of the grass snake were never popular. So, Christianity has never changed the function and the meaning of the grass snake in Lithuanian mythology.</p>
<p>Having said that, the notion of the grass snake being a deity or a spirit is more intricate than that Christianised version of the animal. There were number of different beliefs concerning this animal, so, we could say that the understanding of the grass snake in Lithuanian mythology was rather abstract. In a sense the grass snake could be compared as a house or forest spirit, just in an animal shape. It is quite difficult to locate the grass snake as there is no determined pantheon or order/hierarchy in Lithuanian mythology. For example, the fact that the grass snake as highly associated with the <em>Sun</em> as a deity says nothing as there was a belief that the grass snake was the king of the <em>Underworld</em> too.  Though, these associations were highly based on their symbolic value as there is no description on the fact how does the grass snake perform its duties in the <em>Underworld</em> or being equal to the <em>Sun</em>.</p>
<p>Despite the symbolic associations or the grass snake being a spirit, the creature was actually believed to be the guardian divinity of the household, protecting the family from calamities. Because the grass snake was the divinity of the the household, the grass snake functioned as a deity of fertility. This association can be considered as a natural fact that the secure, lucky home, which also means a  prosperous one, meant a family and having all these advantages, a successful continuation of the generation was possible. Yet in Lithuanian mythology there is a separate deity for the hearth and the household - <em>Gabija</em>. This fact suggests that the grass snake may not have been a fully functioning god in Lithuanian mythology as it is overall a personified natural phenomenon. </p>
<p>One of the more interesting imaginings of the grass snake were the so called ‘‘yellow ears‘‘, which were understood as the crown of the creature as žaltys was not only the guardian divinity, but also an animal of the spiritual world. The kingly depiction of the grass snake in Lithuanian mythology can be understood as an assumption the grass snake was harmless. The notion of the grass snake being responsible for the spiritual world highly relates to the next section regarding the symbolic meaning as the animal was thought to possess the ancestral spirit. </p>
<p><strong>The notion of a symbol:</strong> The grass snake was seen as a totem of ancestral spirits that may still interact with the human beings. As I have previously mentioned, the grass snake was also seen as a related divinity to the <em>Sun</em>. This symbolic power is quite significant as the <em>Sun</em> was held to be one of the most compelling powers in Lithuanian mythology. Thus, we can say that the grass snake had a ''high status'' among the divinities. Surely, we may think  why these two completely different natural phenomena were compared so heavily and similarly depicted. The possible association of the two may also derive from the fact that the grass snake is the guardian deity as well as the deity of the underworld. Now there is not a lot of evidence to support that, but in Lithuanian mythology there is no clear separation from the heaven and the underworld, they both seem to appear ''where the <em>Sun</em> is.</p>
<p>The semi nature of the grass snake may raise even more confusion for those who did not deal with the Lithuanian mythology before. That is why I have made these three main sections covering the function of the grass snake available. These three notions of the grass snake reveal us a sort of triple nature of the creature and they also explain that the grass snake, firstly, is a sacred animal, secondly is a spirit and a minor or abstract deity and thirdly, carries a symbolic meaning as a totem.</p>
