<p>What could be a possible link between scissors and death?</p>
<p>I make a lot of gender distinctions when discussing Lithuanian mythology because they are very important. As I have mentioned before, Lithuanian pagan pantheon is basically female-based. Therefore, it is important for me to remind the reader of the dissimilarities and perhaps no room for comparison. Also, it is significant to see Lithuanian pagan mythology as something completely different and true to itself only.</p>
<p>A direct connection between this tool and death can be found in Lithuanian goddess - <em>Giltinė</em>. This deity is completely different to usual or conventional understanding of death. This divinity essentially has no possible link between a male skeleton riding a horse.</p>
<p>This Lithuanian divinity is a completely opposite to the masculine figure of death we can imagine and these opposing differences are everywhere: in the colour, gender and function as a deity. So, by covering this particular mythological character I intend to nicely expand our  understanding of Lithuanian mythology and emphasise the unconventionality of it. Finally, this post will be accompanied by a second one covering the goddess of destiny and life, who is the sister of the goddess of death. In this way, we will be able to cover Lithuanian mythology from a slightly dissimilar angle, which will hopefully make sense when talking about the key divine figures of the Baltic.</p>
<p>Returning to the goddess of death, we should first concern the fact that she is a female.  Gender plays an important role in the mythological construction of the world. Seeing death as a female shows how archaic and motherly Lithuanian folklore is; it seems that a man is not allowed to decide or take the life away and it is up to a female figure to do so. I personally think that this perception of death as a female figure is highly associated with the female giver- life. We may almost assume that there is a positive connotation lying behind the goddess of death as one cannot possibly avoid the end as well as the beginning. The process of dying is very natural, though gruesome.</p>
<p>It is the goddess of the end, who watches the lives of the human beings. It is extremely important to note that <em>Giltinė</em> is not a goddess of faith, she has nothing to do with the process of decision, that is up to her sister. The name of the goddess itself in the original language means ''to sting'' as some Christian association of poisonous snake. The depiction of this divinity depiction varies quite a lot; again it is unclear how exactly is she supposed to look like (varying from different sources, which were mainly oral).</p>
<p>This particular Lithuanian divinity has an anthropomorphic version of itself: an owl, presumably due to the nocturnal nature of the bird. Owl itself in Lithuanian mythology was held a bird of darkness and moon, on the other hand, shared similar function of the Greek version of the owl. These two different qualities of an owl do not really add up and are clashing, since the goddess of death has nothing to with wisdom or anything like it. Interestingly enough, this goddess of death also bears a role of a messenger of bad news, emphasising the role of observance of the human life. This goddess is very negative, however, in Lithuanian mythology it is clearly understood that nobody can avoid the coming of death.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in the depiction, <em>Giltinė</em> is usually portrayed as a tall, skinny woman with long-shaped face, arms and legs along with a long tongue full of poison.  Generally, this female deity is portrayed as completely white, thus, the colour of death in Lithuanian mythology is white. In some cases, the goddess is portrayed with scissors instead of a tongue or hands, cutting the person and ending the person's life.</p>
<p>In a sense, <em>Giltinė</em> is a controversial creature, people fear her, try to avoid her, it is almost like a spirit that is unwanted. At the same time, this deity defines the Lithuanian understanding of life as a circle. It is important to see that most of the dissimilarities that clash are the pagan and Christian ideas mixed together.</p>
<p>There are many differences regarding the appearance or the signs of death. It is said that if one sees the goddess by the end of the bed, it means the unavoidable death, and in the case of her appearing by the head, a serious illness. It is believed that he animals would feel the coming of this goddess: they would be agitated or at least would try to warn the humans, who cannot sense death. Also, the animals would appear in white colour as an obvious sign. The last group of signs are the paranormal ones and they are usually sound-based, as cracks, knocks, door being opened in the house.</p>
