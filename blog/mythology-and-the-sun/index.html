<p>Since the previous blog post was about the grass snake, by now you have probably figured out that the grass snake and the Sun are both inseparably connected. Both divinities have extremely positive connotation and similar symbolism in archaic Lithuanian belief. However, differently to the grass snake, Sun is more of a cosmological object, it is a purely heavenly and abstract figure, which has basically no direct connection with the Earth. The  only thing that bridges the Sun and the Earthly objects is the order and natural cycle that Sun itself provides. So, this ''big'' connection between the Sun and the grass snake is the actual fact that the Sun hosts the grass snake.</p>
<p>As the grass snake, the Sun is a personified deity in Lithuanian mythology, though this personification is quite weak. As a natural phenomenon, the sun is portrayed as a female, who controls the order in the universe. We should certainly not forget the Sun's husband or sometimes the brother - Moon. This marriage is balanced between the two gender elements in Lithuanian mythology. However, when are talking about the Sun, we must know that the Sun or the <em>female</em> is much more stronger than the male.  Primarily the balance is maintained by the female and not the male because Lithuanian mythology is completely matriarchal.</p>
<p>The matriarchal hierarchy is clearly visible in Lithuanian pantheon of divinities, which means that the most significant deities are actually female. Though when considering this Baltic mythology, we should be careful making such strict judgements about the significance in terms of gender and the gods. Some divinities in Lithuanian mythology came much more later than the other ones, so there is a clear periodical division in the pantheon, when we can actually observe the division between the matriarchal and patriarchal societies.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Lithuanian mythology has kept its key matriarchal figures as the Sun itself. Again the Sun as a divinity was primarily seen as a motherly figure or a female that is responsible for ''its household''. Certainly, the household of the Sun and the humans differs significantly, yet both fall into the same natural circle of life. Also, the Sun symbolises the family and the marriage, though we should look at this association in a more indirect way as this deity is quite distant and abstract.</p>
<p>Thus, we may observe that this  individualisation is quite limited. This deity does not really interact with human beings, she is quite a distant heavenly creature that serves more as a symbol rather than a person.  If the grass snake can turn into a human being, the Sun is not able to do that. The Sun as a goddess remains in the heavens and does not interact or change her forms. At this point, we should know that this divinity is strictly agrarian based, so it serves as a calendar for the people. </p>
<p>On the other hand, an indirect contact with the human beings does manifest through the natural cycles. Now what do I mean by that? In Lithuanian mythology and in practice, people were following the cycles of nature, which could be perceived as the day, night, month and year.Lithuanian people in general were very close to the nature, which is highly visible in their mythology: the collection of beliefs is very much agrarian based, there are a lot of animal deities, which signifies the respect for the nature and so on.  So, in this way, Lithuanians would cherish and possibly even  talk or pray to the Sun to thank and ask the Sun for favours.  Again, this type of communication is not entirely personal, it is more of a worship of celestial  being that does not imply the Sun being of an anthropomorphic nature.</p>
<p>So, if the Sun is quite an abstract deity, what symbolic meaning does it have? How exactly does the figure of Sun apply in Lithuanian mythology? As you can see in the pictures of this ''post'', the Sun primarily is a circle or in other words, a cycle.  In addition to that, the cycle or the circle is constantly moving and changing. The qualities of the symbol as a cycle and a changing object are essential to our understanding of the Sun in Lithuanian mythology. Just because the Sun is a cycle, it means this deity is the mother of the nature, the mother of Earth, and  in a sense, the creator. Finally, the Sun is responsible for the order of the universe as we can see in the vivid depictions of the Sun.</p>
<p>There is a lot to think about consider the Sun as a deity, it has a lot of different forms in terms of depiction, meaning and associations. As I have mentioned earlier, the Sun as a divinity is supposed carry a completely positive meaning, which in the process of <em>Christianisation</em> is transformed into an opposing power to the evil or the devil. So, in a sense with the process of Christianisation, the Sun became the protector from the bad and the evil. I would dare to claim that it did have a similar value in the very early times as well. Logically, the Sun could be regarded as a symbol of light, which would mean that this deity would protect, symbolise the energy, labour and, therefore, the good in agrarian Lithuanian society.</p>
<p>Now in the first image of this ''post'' the depiction of the Sun as symbol differs significantly to the second image. Here we again face the issue of the Christianisation process. In the second image we can observe a mix of the so called Christian cross and the Sun. The reason of this particular mix is simple: even in Christianity, the light takes an important role. Thus, the Sun, which is a celestial being is used as an expression of light and divinity. However, having this mixture at hand we may consider the problem of idolatry. Finally, if to carefully look at the both images, the first image shows the locality of the understanding of the divinity, meanwhile, the latter demonstrates the universality of Christian belief.</p>
