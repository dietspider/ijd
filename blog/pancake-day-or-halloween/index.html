<p>Every year, as the end of January approaches, I always start thinking about Shrove Tuesday. Each year Shrove Tuesday is celebrated on a different day of (usually) February. Having said that, every time I check the calendar and make sure I will be ready to cook a bunch of pancakes for this occasion. However, in a lot of countries Shrove Tuesday lost its traditions or in some other cases, it became a Christian celebration marking the time before Lent. </p>\n\n<p>Despite that, Lithuanian people celebrate Shrove Tuesday to this day attempting to keep all the practices of the feast. Therefore, I am going to try and explain the celebration of Shrove Tuesday from a Lithuanian perspective and its tradition dating back to the pagan practices and beliefs. In this blog post I will be using the English version of this celebration, which is Shrove Tuesday due to its accurate meaning that is able to describe it. \"Shrove\" is the past tense for the verb \"shrive\", which denotes to penance, confession and absolution.  </p>\n\n<p>The Lithuanian word for this feast is <em>Užgavėnės</em> and it corresponds well with the title of Shrove Tuesday as both of them to some extent refer to penance and neglect of something. Even though they both may sound so \"Christian\" on the surface, there is quite more to that. This kind of penance may be simply seen as a rite of purification, which is caused by the change of season and thus, the change in nature. A lot of Lithuanian pagan festivities are aligned with the cycles (seasons) of nature due to the cyclical or eternal understanding of time as opposed to the linear Christian understanding of time. </p>\n\n<p>The date of Shrove Tuesday was and is determined depending on the date of Easter, which has 46 days or 7 weeks to it. The feast also occurs on the eve of Ash Wednesday when the penitential period begins in order to mourn and wait for the resurrection of Christ. The contrast of Lithuanian <em>Užgavėnės</em> and Ash Wednesday is vast, as they are as extreme opposites. <em>Užgavėnės</em> marks the excess and celebration in its literal sense, whereas the penitential period is a time of reflection, silence and fasting. </p>\n\n<p>Clearly we can observe the religious differences between these two celebrations despite the fact that the two are connected these days. It is not entirely clear what the origin of Shrove Tuesday is, but it certainly started as a pagan festivity. The origin suggested for Lithuanian Shrove Tuesday lies within the Slavic myths and traditions (Jarilo deity). However, to consider this feast as simply Slavic would be wrong because the legend of Jarilo fighting demons and evil spirits does not convince us about the seasonal change which is so important in Lithuanian pagan mythology. It might just have been a combination of the two or a common practice, given the struggle presented by winter throughout the Eastern European regions.</p>\n\n<p>Having said it many times, the centrality and purpose of <em>Užgavėnės</em> is to fight against everything that is connected with evil and winter, which can be seen as a part of purification process. This sort of evil power and winter is battled with mockery, laughing, games, singing, dancing and everything that is connected with excess&mdash;even cross-dressing. That is how we move on to the importance of food during this feast. </p>\n\n<p>During <em>Užgavėnės</em> people would devour food, especially meat and \"fatty\" meals in particular. Even the frequency of eating would be highly encouraged, that could even be up to 10-12 times. The key meal of this celebration was, and remains to this day, pancakes. The variety of pancakes Lithuanian people would make even up to this date is vast and this embodies the theme of excess throughout. However, other meals that would be eaten are: doughnuts, buns, pretzels, aspic, bacon and other meaty dishes (including potatoes, boiled leg of a pig, et cetera). </p>\n\n<p>It is also important to mark that these meals had a meaning and were part of the ritual. The frequent eating and vast amount of food would guarantee a good coming year with respect to harvest, luck, wealth and even health. In addition to that, the food would be distributed to the poor or the needy. Perhaps the most popular association with food was and is marked with the fight of the so called \"hemper\" and \"porker\". Both figures would represent spring and the victory of one over the other would foreshadow the quality of the coming spring. </p>\n\n<p>So far nothing seems to remind us of a Christian celebration when looking at the Lithuanian Shrove Tuesday. On the other hand we should always think that, if this celebration has remained unchanged even after the period of late Christianisation, it was important for the people to keep it. Returning to <em>Užgavėnės</em>, another common practice was to simply rest. Some might even compare the style of this celebration to a carnival. If one would have to choose a word to describe this feast it would be the word \"playful\". The playful nature of this feast was and is expressed through the wearing of masks and weird clothing.</p>\n\n<p>Some might even want to associate this kind of mask-wearing and the festive nature of this carnival with the Celtic feast of Halloween. Indeed it does share some similarities: <em>Užgavėnės</em> is meant to fight against the old and bad spirits while wearing scary masks and clothing. Also, the usual characters that were and are picked would be relate to the understanding of evil: witches, hags, the reaper, gypsies and devils (though other characters used would be animals).</p>\n\n<p>These typical characters of <em>Užgavėnės</em> were not accepted by society and the choice to portray them changed throughout time. In the case of animals, the choice emphasised the comical nature of this celebration. The ability to transform into anything reflects the importance of fighting winter, which is so central in Lithuanian Shrove Tuesday. Moreover, this struggle against the season of winter is a way to express the understanding of what is good and evil, pure and polluted.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <em>Užgavėnės</em> can be described as a highly ritualised celebration that reaches its apogee with the burning of <em>Morė</em>&mdash;the effigy of a winter spirit (<em>see fig.1</em>). This effigy is most commonly portrayed as an ugly woman, made of old material, straw and wood. The burning of this effigy marks the attempt to win this battle over evil.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly now we can see that Lithuanian <em>Užgavėnės</em> has barely anything to do with Christian tradition. It is a pagan celebration of excess and fighting, which is embellished by many rituals and traditions that are with us to this day.</p>\n\n<p>The cover photo of this blog post is taken from <a href=\"www.ciurlionis.lt\">www.ciurlionis.lt</a> </p>
