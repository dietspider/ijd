<p>In this post I am going to introduce you to another female deity, <em>Laumė</em>, whose name is not amenable to translation in any mythology. The most similar female figures present in other mythologies would be witches or faeries, and I have chosen to cover <em>Laumė</em> due to the features which set her apart from them.</p>
<p><em>Laumė</em> is a female creature who is completely unique in her physical and spiritual form. The resulting mystique surrounding her nature is only augmented by the fact that no archaic illustrated depictions of her have survived to the present day. There is, in fact, no consensus regarding how <em>Laumė</em> should look at all, and the understanding of her is purely anecdotal.</p>
<p>In order to imagine how this creature ought to look, I have provided some contemporary impressions by <strong>Stasys Eidrigevičius</strong>—master illustrator of various folk tales. I have chosen this specific artist because I believe his depictions of <em>Laumė</em> are the most accurate.</p>
<p>The atmosphere that this artist creates echoes that of primitivist works, which is appropriate given <em>Laumė's</em> earliest emergence in the hunter-gatherer period. The artist is deliberately ambiguous in his depiction of her: formidable in both a divine and beastly way. This dubious portrayal of Laumė hints to the realities when treating this creature in a discussion of Lithuanian mythology: is she a goddess or a beast?</p>
<p>Even though, as I have previously commented, there is no clarity in the depiction of this goddess, the only certain feature is the fact that this divinity is necessarily ugly. When we are imagining this creature, we must not forget two major factors regarding our understanding of <em>Laumė</em>: her segregated habitat and the function of this creature in Lithuanian mythology as a punisher. These two factors are crucial in Lithuanian mythology and each divinity comes with a place as well as the function predestined as there is no Olympus for Lithuanian gods to inhabit.</p>
<p>The major function of this goddess is, in a sense, similar to the function of the 'pagan witch', which is to sustain the balance of life. In this case, the maintenance of balance refers to presiding over a person's right to live. Having this quality in mind, one could say that this Lithuanian deity is highly dependent on nature and, therefore, natural cycles. The places that <em>Laumė</em> usually inhabits are swamps, lakes in the forest and foggy fields. Now, we cannot regard this creature as a forest or water deity because she is a bit of both.</p>
<p>The most frightening descriptions of <em>Laumė</em> are to be found in folklore and children's tales. In such tales, this deity would only visit rural communities, where she is still feared to this day. This creature's presence was—and in some cases still is—significant only in rural areas because of the easy access to the "open nature".</p>
<p>The actual appearance of <em>Laumė</em> can be imagined as an inescapable predator: once the fog comes or there is nobody outside, this female creature would appear and snatch children away from negligent parents. Note the use of the word 'predator' to differentiate <em>Laumė</em> from superficially similar deities as the Greek Nemesis, who would need to be summoned or would punish only those who deserved it.</p>
<p>In folklore, once the child is taken, he/she would either never return or would return deformed. <em>Laumė</em> was by no means limited to preying upon children, however. In the case of adult men, <em>Laumė</em> would usually seduce and later kill men for being immoral or weak-willed with respect to ephemeral pleasures. Though sometimes there is no clear motive or justification for her attacks, this creature ultimately existed to punish the immoral. The victims or the targets typically (though not always) deserved the punishment they received and it was basically impossible to escape this 'divine punishment'.</p>\n\n<p>One might be tempted to question how <em>Laumė</em> actually maintains the balance if she simply kidnaps or kills children. The function of this entity may seem entirely didactic, primarily serving as a lesson for immoral people. <em>Laumė's</em> function and removal from peers in comparable mythologies is far deeper, however, as she would almost paradoxically bring good fortune to caring and moral examples in rural communities.</p>
<p>As it can be observed, there is no universal "version" of <em>Laumė</em> in Lithuanian mythology. The portrayal of this female figure usually depends on a region and historical timing.In a lot of cases this creature is seen as malevolent and unforgiving, however, this malevolent behaviour can be justified through the aspect of justice. </p>
<p>The depiction varies significantly in Lithuanian mythology. According to one type of source material, they are zoomorphic creatures: a combination of a woman and a pigeon, goat, cat, bear or even dog.  According to the other sources, <em>Laumė</em> is seen as an ugly old woman, almost of a non-human nature, with a possible rotten, disfigured face and weird body. It is also suggested that this deity can look even beautiful, usually seen naked, with long wavy hair and long breasts.</p>
<p>All these various depictions of <em>Laumė</em> may suggest, that this creature existed as a reflection of the community and its issues regarding women. Moving on from that, we may encounter another issue regarding this mythological character, which is the comparison between her and a witch.</p>
<p>Overall, it is hard to separate the influence of Christian belief(s) regarding witches from the "archaic" imaginings of a witch (possibly <em>Laumė</em>). One cannot deny that there are striking similarities between the two. The fact that the Lithuanian mythological creature steals, eats and deforms or curses children can be seen as a direct influence on the construction of a "Christian Witch". </p>
<p>The evil and anti-social behaviour, connection and manipulation of the natural forces show how similar <em>Laumė</em> can be to the Christian version of a witch. Even though they both share some qualities, one should not associate these female characters. <em>Laumė</em> is essentially a divinity, therefore, all of her actions are justified and, thus, belong to the order of nature.</p>
