<h4>So, what is this blog about?</h4>
<p>I think I am going to simply start of with some clarifications in the subject of history. My aim in this blog is not to translate or repeat any works of historians, but to simply reflect my understanding of particular areas of interest that I think are problematic. That is why I am going to begin with the issues covering Lithuanian mythology as there are quite a few misconceptions and lack of knowledge regarding the Lithuanian beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lithuanian mythology, the approach I am planning to use here will be rather plain. Through focusing on single examples, I will reveal the core of the Lithuanian beliefs and practices. Yes, this is an unusual way of doing it, however, due to the possible distance between Western and Eastern audiences, I think it will be easier to take one thing at a time. My approach is obvious: instead of simply mentioning the fact that grass snake is important I shall explain why and make a little case study. </p>
<p>Perhaps now you have noticed that the question "why?" is inevitable, it is the main question in history and indeed it is probably the only question that leads us somewhere in this subject. Only by searching for reason and purpose, unlike in other subjects, we are able reconstruct the image of our past. In this way, the question "why?" enables us to understand the intricacies of the time, despite the past and the present distance.</p>
